These are basic scripts used to make hosting simpler on my CentOS setup

enablewww username domainincluding.com
 enablewww enables hosting for the specified domain and username.
 If the user doesnt exist it will create it, so you probably have to run this as sudo.
 This creates a directory structure under /home/username/ and should set permissions properly.
 It also creates the vhosts file for apache and the configuration for named (the DNS service).
 THIS OVERWRITES CONFIGURATIONS for now

enabledns username domainincluding.com
 enabledns enables dns for your self hosted name server.

disablewww username domainincluding.com
 disablewww disables the hosting for the specified domain under the user.
 This just destroys symlinks and no actual configurations.

listwww
 listwww lists all the enabled sites on this server
 It's a nice way of seeing which vhosts are being used 

hosting.conf
 hosting.conf is a file that contains some configuration variables for the system
 Modify this to adjust these scripts for your system.
 An ubuntu version is provided in hosting.ubuntu.conf. Overwrite hosting.conf with that for ubunut.
